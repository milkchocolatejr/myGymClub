# Notes about Flask....

## How it works

The 'runner.py' will execute the 'run' function. This function will start the app; this should open a localhost port. After that, we can control web traffic. For specific types of requests, we can view the request data and package our dyanamic webpage response. You are welcome to reference my old project to see an example of this working.

The files are named similarly. This is a larger scale example of Flask at work from CS 480.
